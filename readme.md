## Unit Test FooBar

Write a PHP script that prints all integer values from 1 to 100.
For multiples of three output "Foo" instead of the value and for the multiples of five output "Bar". Values which are multiples of both three and five should output as "FooBar".

Remembering that this script must be based on tests.

## Why?

I am studying tests and I would like to see what your thinking is like. So try not to see my solution. Based on your answers, I will improve the solution here.
